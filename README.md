# Robot Car with Manual Control, Line Follower, avioding car
This is a project for building a robot car that can be manually controlled using Bluetooth and can also follow a line and aviod Obstacles. The project is based on an Arduino and requires some basic knowledge of electronics and programming.

## Components
The following are the main components required for this project:

* Arduino Uno 
* L298N motor driver
* HC-05 Bluetooth module
* IR sensor module
* Chassis with motors and wheels
* 9V battery or power source
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard  

## Usage

#### The robot car can be used in the following ways:

1. Manual control using Bluetooth: Use the mobile app to control the robot car manually using Bluetooth. The app allows you to move the robot car forward, backward, left and right.
2. Autonomous line following: Switch to autonomous mode to make the robot car follow a line. The robot car uses the IR sensor module to detect the line and adjust its direction accordingly.  
3. Aviod Obstacles: Switch to aviod mode to make the robot car aviod Obstacles. The robot car uses the ultraSonic sensor module to detect the Obstacles and adjust its direction accordingly.
